# Diagnostic-Interface
This user interface is designed using QtDesigner from ITOM. It is used for an Avantes spectrometer (a grabber plugin on ITOM) and a general camera (for which an ITOM plugin is available). Options to capture live feed from the devices as well as take snapshots are available. The integration time for the spectrometer can also be entered.
